## The config file

You will need to add a handful of configuration items to your `config.toml` file. You can take a look at the [example site](https://github.com/mattstratton/castanet/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml) to see them in action. They are described below:

### Top-level items

- `googleAnalytics` - the Google Analytics tracking ID. We use the async method. Example: `"UA-123-45"`
- `paginate` - The number of episodes to show per-page on the homepage (note, this also controls pagination for Guest and Host list pages). If this is not set, the default is 10.

### General Parameters

These should be set under the `[params]` section:

| Field Name              | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Example                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Link Parameters

To generate the list of links in the sidebar, you will set them in the `config.toml` similar to this:

```
[params.links]
  [params.links.ado]
    name = "Arrested DevOps"
    url = "https://www.arresteddevops.com"
  [params.links.ffs]
    name = "Food Fight Show"
    url = "https://foodfightshow.org"
  [params.links.sdt]
    name = "Software Defined Talk"
    url = "https://cote.io/podcasts/sdt/"
```

The identifier for the link simply needs to be unique; it's not used anywhere else.

### A note about `BaseURL`

This theme is fairly dependent upon a proper `BaseURL` being set in the `config.toml`. This has to do with how the feed is generated as well as some of the social metadata (these things cannot be relative URL's). I'm fully aware that this can cause issues with some build systems, and I'm trying to work on a good solution for this. This must end in a slash. Example: `https://www.arresteddevops.com/`

### Pagination setting with grid layout

If you are using the grid layout, you need to ensure that your pagination is set to a multiple of 3. For example, in your config file:

```
paginate = "9"
```

### Permalinks

I recommend the following permalink settings, although the theme will work just fine without them:

```
[permalinks]
	page = "/:filename/"
	about = "/:filename/"
	episode = "/:filename/"
```

### Menus

Castanet supports menus with up to one submenu per menu item. The menu name must be "Main", and the menus are sorted based upon their identifier. At this time, you must have at least one menu item, or the theme will error out.

Example:
```
[[Menu.Main]]
    name = "About"
    identifier = "about"
    url = "about"

[[Menu.Main]]
    name = "Contact"
    identifier = "contact"
    url = "contact"

[[Menu.Main]]
    name = "Hosts"
    identifier = "hosts"
    url = "host"

[[Menu.Main]]
    name = "Guests"
    identifier = "guests"
    url = "guest"

[[Menu.Main]]
    name = "Resources"
    identifier = "resources"
    url = "#!"

[[Menu.Main]]
    name = "Books"
    identifier = "books"
    url = "books"
    parent = "resources"
[[Menu.Main]]
    name = "Podcasts"
    identifier = "podcasts"
    url = "books"
    parent = "resources"
    
```

### Podlove Subscribe Button

[Podlove Subscribe Button](https://subscribe-button.podlove.org/) is a universal and easy-to-use button, to subscribe to podcasts with player clients or website players. 
To customize your button please add the following section to your `config.toml`, which covers all features which are provided by the generator on [subscribe-button.podlove.org](https://subscribe-button.podlove.org/).

```
[params.podlove]
  subscribe_title = ""              # fallback: site title from above
  subscribe_subtitle = ""           # fallback: ""
  subscribe_description = ""        # fallback: ""
  subscribe_cover = "img/logo.jpg"  # fallback: ""
  subscribe_color = "#585e6c"       # fallback: ""
  subscribe_size = "medium"         # options: small, medium, big
  subscribe_format = "rectangle"    # options: rectangle, square, cover
  subscribe_style = "filled"        # options: filled, outline, frameless
  subscribe_language = "de"         # options: nl (dutch), en (english), eo (esperanto), de (german), fi (finnish), fr (french), ja (french)
  subscribe_feed_type = "audio"     # options: audio, video
  subscribe_feed_format = "mp3"     # options: mp3, aac, ogg, opus
```

## Episodes

Every episode requires a page in the `content/episode` on your site. The command `hugo new episode/myepisode.md` should populate it properly.

An episode file takes the following structure:

| `transcript`       | No       | The path to the transcript file. The file can have Markdown or be in HTML. It must be relative to the root of your site (this is a file path, not a URL). It is recommended to put them in your `static` directory so that Hugo doesn't try to process them.      | "/static/transcripts/chatops.txt" |
| `upcoming`       | No       | Boolean value if the episode should be considered "upcoming" and not published. Values include `true` or `false`. If set to `true`, the episode will not show up in episode lists (including guest and host pages) and will not be part of the feed. Upcoming episodes will be listed on the "Upcoming" page if created.      | true |

### Upcoming Episodes

If you would like to display upcoming episodes, you need to do a couple things. First, you will need to create a page where the upcoming episodes will be listed. You can check out `exampleSite` for an example, but basically, you want to create `content/upcoming/_index.md`. 

Any episodes that have `upcoming` in their frontmatter set to `true` will be listed here, but not listed on any other pages (feed, home page, guest pages, etc). Additionally, episodes that are marked as "upcoming" will not display a YouTube video or audio player, even if those parameters are set.

Note: you will need to set `buildFuture = true` in your `config.toml` to allow Hugo to build upcoming episodes that are dated in the future.

## Guests

If you don't have guests on your episodes, feel free to ignore this section.

### Guest Pages

Every guest on your show needs a corresponding page  in the `content/guest` directory of your site. Generally speaking, you should be able to name these however you like, but I have only tested it with the format `firstinitiallastname.md`, i.e., for "John Doe" the file would be `jdoe.md`.

A guest file takes the following structure:

```
+++
Title = "John Doe"
Twitter = "johndoe"
Website = "http://www.google.com"
Type = "guest"
Facebook = "johndoe"
Linkedin = "johndoe"
GitHub = "johndoe"
Thumbnail = "img/guest/jdoe.jpg"
Twitch = "johndoe"
YouTube = "johndoe"
Aka = ["jsmith", "jsmith2"]

| `guest_group`       | No       | Set to an identifier to mark guests as being different versions of the same person. Only the most recent file in a guest group will appear on the Guests page.

## Hosts

Host information comes from host pages. You can use the shortcode TODO: add shortcode

### Host Pages

Every host  needs a corresponding page  in the `content/host` directory of your site. Generally speaking, you should be able to name these however you like, but I have only tested it with the format `firstinitiallastname.md`, i.e., for "John Doe" the file would be `jdoe.md`.

A host file takes the following structure:


```
+++
Title = "John Doe"
Twitter = "johndoe"
Website = "http://www.google.com/"
Type = "host"
Facebook = "johndoe"
Linkedin = "johndoe"
GitHub = "johndoe"
Thumbnail = "img/host/johndoe.png"
Pinterest = "johndoe"
Instagram = "johndoe"
YouTube = "johndoe"
Twitch = "johndoe"

If you want to use the default, set this to `""`. Optional. If left blank, or not existent, a default image will be provided. You can replace this default image by putting a new 500 px x 500 px PNG image at `/static/img/guest/default-guest.png` in your site (not in the theme!).

## Sponsors

If your podcast doesn't have sponsors, feel free to disregard this section.

Sponsors are made up of two portions - a data file that describes the sponsor, and the banner image for the sponsor. The sponsor data files are stored in `data/sponsors`, and each file needs to be named after the identifier for the sponsor. There are three fields for each sponsor, and they are all required. An example sponsorfile would look like this:

`data/sponsors/bluthcompany.yml`

```
name: bluthcompany
url: "https://www.google.com"
ad: "img/sponsors/bluthcompany.jpg"
```

The ad can either be a fully qualified URL (such as `https://www.google.com/images/bluth.jpg`) or a path relative to your `static` directory.
