This rule standardizes how we work with Hugo in this project.

- Always use the `Store` method for passing data inside and outside of loops or blocks, especially for pagination and sharing computed values.
- Avoid using the older `Scratch` approach unless working with legacy code.
- Use clear, descriptive keys when storing values in `Store` (e.g., `paginator`, `featuredPost`).
- See [layouts/_partials/grid.html](mdc:layouts/_partials/grid.html) for an example of `Store` usage.
